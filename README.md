### File Overview

#### 1. **Header Inclusions**
   - **Windows.h**: Core Windows API functionalities.
   - **d3d9.h**: Direct3D 9 functions and types.
   - **d3dx9.h**: Utility functions for Direct3D, particularly for 2D line drawing.
   - **TlHelp32.h**: Functions for creating snapshots of processes, useful for process enumeration.
   - **chrono**: C++ standard library for high-resolution timing.

#### 2. **Global Variables**
   - **Offsets**: Predefined offsets to access entity attributes like health, team, and position.
   - **Direct3D Variables**: Variables for Direct3D objects (device, line drawing).

#### 3. **Function Definitions**
   - **GetGameProcessId**: Retrieves the process ID of the specified game by iterating through all running processes. Uses `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` and `Process32First/Next`.
   
   - **FindEntityListBaseAddress**: Placeholder function intended to locate the base address of the entity list in the game's memory. Currently returns a hardcoded address.
   
   - **EnumWindowsProc**: Callback function for enumerating all open windows. Looks for the game window based on its title.
   
   - **InitD3D**: Initializes Direct3D by creating a Direct3D object, setting presentation parameters, and creating a device for rendering.
   
   - **DrawESPBox**: Draws a bounding box around entities using lines. Takes parameters for position, dimensions, and color.
   
   - **WindowProc**: Window procedure that handles messages for the overlay window, including resizing and destruction.
   
   - **EnableDebugPrivilege**: Attempts to enable debug privileges for the process, allowing memory reading from other processes.

#### 4. **Main Function**
   - Retrieves the game process ID.
   - Enables debug privileges.
   - Opens the game process with memory reading permissions.
   - Finds the base address for the entity list.
   - Enumerates windows to find the game's window.
   - Sets up the overlay window with transparency.
   - Initializes Direct3D.
   - Main loop:
     - Clears the screen and begins a new scene.
     - Reads health, team, and position data for each entity from the gameâ€™s memory.
     - Draws ESP boxes for entities that are not on the player's team and have health greater than zero.
     - Ends the scene and presents the drawn frame.
     - Maintains a target frame rate of 60 FPS.

#### 5. **Error Handling**
   - Includes checks for failure in various operations, such as finding the game process, reading memory, and creating Direct3D objects, with console output for debugging.

#### 6. **Cleanup**
   - Releases Direct3D objects and handles to avoid memory leaks before exiting.

### Important Considerations
- **Offsets and Addresses**: The code contains placeholder values for memory offsets. These values will need to be replaced with the correct offsets for the specific version of the game being targeted.
- **Performance**: The frame rate control mechanism is basic and may not provide perfectly smooth rendering in all circumstances.
